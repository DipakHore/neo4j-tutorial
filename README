Neo4j Koans
===========

This set of Koans will provide practical guidance for getting to grips with graph data structures and operations using the Neo4j open source graph database. It's part of a more comprehensive tutorial being developed by the [authors](#authors) which will make its way into conference tutorials soon enough.

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need to be familiar with the Java programming language, and it'd be helpful if you understood a unit testing too. All the graph database knowledge you'll needed will be developed as part of completing the Koans.
